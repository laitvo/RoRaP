# RoRaP (**Ro**tational **Ra**man Screening of **P**lasma Systems)
The documentation to RoRaP will be made available via a program website.

## Quick ReadMe
The program is responsible for a simpler reading-out of rotational Raman spectra collected via screening a plasma system. 

`__init__.py` is an arbitrary code file responsible for loading the library. The actual loading of an experimental spectral image is accomplished by the `fiber.py` module.
`filters.py` introduces a simpler Gaussian filter further used in estimating the noise level `noise.py` and, subsequently, the spectral base line (`bline.py`). Experimental signal peaks may be detected by using `pdetect.py` and assigned via `assign.py`. The peaks detected may then undergo deterministic or stochastic numerical fitting of line or band profiles (`pfit.py`). Finally, `raman.py` contains computational tools for drawing a theoretical rotational spectrum based on Dunham series coefficients and selection rules, which may be optimised onto an experimental record to draw temperature and chemical composition data. Limited case studies are suggested by inserting molecular constant dictionaries.
